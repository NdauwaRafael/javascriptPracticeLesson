1. Write a JavaScript program to delete the rollno property from the following object. Also print the object before or after deleting the property.
    ```
    let  student = { 
        name : "David Rayy", 
        sclass : "VI", 
        rollno : 12 
    };
    ```
2.  Pick a penguin from Wikipedia's [List of Fictional Penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_penguins) and create an object named myPenguin with properties that represent the information listed in each column on that Wikipedia page (for example: the character's name, origin, and author).
3. Use console.log() to print the penguin's name to the console as part of a welcome message, like 
    > "Hello, I'm a penguin and my name is [NAME HERE]!".
4.  Write another line of code that adds a new property to your penguin called `canFly` and set it to `false`. (Note: Don't modify your penguin-creation code that you wrote above! Do this step in a separate line of code.)
5. Add a method to your penguin called `chirp` that prints to the `console`: **"CHIRP CHIRP!** Is this what penguins sound like?" (Note: Again, don't modify your previous code! Do this step by writing a new line of code.)
6. Add another method to your penguin called `sayHello` that prints to the `console` the same message from step 2 above. But this time, be sure to use the mystical, magical, all-powerful `this` keyword to access your penguin's name, so that way the `sayHello` method could potentially work for any penguin that has a name!
7. Next, call your penguin's `sayHello()` method and make sure that it works! (Hint: if you need an example of what it looks like when you call a method of an object, look at `console.log()` -- that's how you call the `log()` method of the `console` object!)
8. Without modifying any of your previous code, change the penguin's name to "Penguin McPenguinFace" and then call your penguin's `sayHello()` function one more time to make sure it still works.
